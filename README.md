## Simulation of airplane boarding methods
Methods simulated: Back to front, Blocks, Wilma, Steffen and Random.

The simulation is visualized in Unity and the crowd simulation system is Jack Shabo's High Density Crowd Simulation. 

This repo is part of the Computer Science Degree Thesis: "Recreating optimized airplane boarding methods using real-time Crowd Simulation" by Tim Runstr√∂m and Oscar Olsson.
